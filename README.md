# Katas

## What is kata?

The original word comes from [martial arts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kata). In software
engineering the goal of katas is to provide a new member of the team with a set of pre-arranged
exercises to build understanding of the tools used by the team.

## What would you need?

1. A developer machine (hopefully you already got a shiny new macbook pro before you started reading
   this)
2. Decent IDE of your choice (recommended [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/))
3. Tools (Everything in brackets is recommendation, if you know your way around feel free to follow
   what is intuitive for you!)
    1. [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/), installing everything else would be a breeze!
    2. git (`brew install git`)
    3. JDK (`brew install --cask corretto`)
    4. NodeJS (`brew install nodejs npm`)
    5. Python (`brew install python`)
    5. AWS Cli (`brew install awscli`)

## Things that would help you move faster.

1. Knowing your way around terminal and CLI.
